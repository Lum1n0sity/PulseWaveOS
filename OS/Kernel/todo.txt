Write Assembly Code: Start by writing a minimal assembly language program. This program will serve as the kernel's entry point. It should set up essential system registers, initialize the stack, and transition to C code.

Write a Bootloader: You'll need a bootloader to load your kernel into memory and start its execution. Popular bootloaders like GRUB can be used for this purpose.

Write C Code: Begin writing C code for your kernel. You can start with simple "Hello World" programs to ensure that your C compiler is set up correctly. Gradually build up your kernel's functionality, including memory management, interrupts, and basic I/O.

Set Up a Debugging Environment: Use tools like GDB (GNU Debugger) and QEMU (Quick Emulator) for testing and debugging your kernel. QEMU can emulate various CPU architectures and help you test your kernel without physical hardware.

Implement Key Kernel Features: As your kernel evolves, add essential features such as memory management, process management, interrupt handling, and file system support. The exact order and features will depend on your project's goals.

Testing: Continuously test your kernel as you add functionality. Create test cases to validate different components of your kernel, such as system calls, interrupts, and device drivers.

Documentation: Document your kernel's design, architecture, and APIs. Good documentation is essential for future maintenance and collaboration.

Version Control: Use a version control system like Git to keep track of changes in your kernel source code. Host your project on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaboration and source code management.
